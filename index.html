            What is parallax scrolling?
            Parallax scrolling is a technique long used in computer graphics to create a 3D-like sense of depth in 2D
            scenes. Based on the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation, it involves making a
            background image pass more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of distance. <br><br>

            It's basically an optical illusion that takes advantage of the way the human eye sees closer objects as
            larger and faster than things that are further away. Over the last decade or so, it's been used in
            responsive web design to help create a more seamless, immersive experience. <br><br>
        </p>
        <h2>How do I create a parallax scrolling website?</h2>
        <p>
            Parallax scrolling can be created using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is the coding language used to
            design the appearance of a website, to set the positions and responses of different visual elements (see our
            tutorials on creating cool CSS animation effects). <br><br>

            For example, you can fix the position of a background image for a section so that it stays still while other
            elements move. The easiest way to make a website with parallax scrolling if you're not a web designer is to
            use a pre-designed template that incorporates this effect. <br><br>
